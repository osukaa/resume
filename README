# My Readme

This is a fork where based on the template I created my own CV for you to check ;)

# Old Readme

This is my resume in LaTeX

It is based off a template I found a few years ago, which was a modified template, see the (C) list at the top for a history.

I have also included the original templates (along the path to my resume).

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux a simple
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
should kick out a resumeName.pdf

Good luck and happy job hunting! (PS As of September 2011 I am looking for a job :) )
